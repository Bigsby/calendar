    <h1>Bigsby - Calendar</h1>
    <p>Trying multiple web technologies to build a simple calendar web app.</p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>As it should be, in my opinion, every layer is to be looked upon as a separate project and, thus, replacing one
        tecnology for another in the same layer should have no implications to the rest of the solution. This means
        technologies like Django Templates or MVC Razor are out of the equation. This also means that development,
        build and hosting is also completely seperate.</p>
