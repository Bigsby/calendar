# Web Calendar
Trying multiple web technologies to build a simple calendar web app.

## Architecture
As it should be, in my opinion, every layer is to be looked upon as a separate project and, thus, replacing one tecnology for another in the same layer should have no implications to the rest of the solution. This means technologies like Django Templates or MVC Razor are out of the equation. This also means that development, build and hosting is also completely seperate.
